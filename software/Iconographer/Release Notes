bugs to be fixed:
 - "all formats" item for open dialog
- pasting something in one bit, inverting doesn't invert everything, painting on one side affects the other too (pointers overlap...)

possibiles issues:
- garbage on right side when dragging diagonal gradient to huge size
- when using click there it is, dragging save dialog causes it to dissapear
- crashes involving icon info dialog
- possible crashes with pop-up in save dialog
 - standard event filter not refresing properly background windows (640 x 480, 16-bit, Mac OS 8.5)
 - copying something over to the 8-bit mask, using option-delete to fill it, not all filled (garbage?), undoing and doing it again works (selectionGW problems?) (640 x 480, 16-bit, Mac OS 8.5)
- type anti-aliasing issues with japanese version

shoulds:
- different centering styles for MAlert
- settable default button for MAlert
- hovering over RGB/HSB slider previous should show color in readout
- picking should work from another editor's color swatch
- readout should show up when in another editor's drawing area
- should move all control functions as static function members of the class they belong to
- remember current tab
- move palette on screen if not within new screen bounds (when res changes, etc.)
- look into icon browser overdraw
- 8-bit system palette balloon help should explain each section
- clicking in preview should set slider to that color
- icm* support
- disable unavailable bit depths depending on format

little things for 1.2:
- deleting icons from Icon Browser
- refreshing icon browser when an icon is saved

Future stuff (planned version in parantheses):
- loading of file icons when dragged into side display/preview (1.1)
- popup menu with magnifications (1.1)
- 8 bit selections (so that text can be anti-aliased, and dragged data can be placed into a proper selection). (1.1)
- proxy icons (1.1)
- screen grab command (1.1)
- tear-off palettes (1.1/1.5)
- .tiff saving (1.1/1.5)

- split up picture into icons command (1.1/1.5)
- transformations (at least scaling, possibly others too). (1.5)
- contextual menus (1.5)
- insertion/saving into .ICL/.DLL files (1.5)
- integration with glypher (1.5)
- transparency controls for tools (1.5/2.0)

- paste into selection command, scales clipboard contents to current selection size  
- HTML based help (drag Iconographer Help folder to Help folder in System Folder, and then open up the Help Center if you want searching and help menu to work), feedback wanted (if your name isn't listed in the testers paragram in the Program Info section, well, that's because you weren't much of a tester, so now's your change to remedy that :p)
