Remaining to be implemented (for 1.0):
- optimize lasso...
- dragging files loads their icons instead of rejecting them
- fix background disabling problems when switching among windows
- help (both balloon and html based)
- reduce flickering in side display (GWorld buffering?)
- preview for labels, etc (need UI for this...)
- use tab to cycle through icon size/depths
- eye dropper should work across editors

Bugs in pre 8.5 systems:
- crash when displaying Nav Services dialog
- when opening files that have a custom icon but its 8.5+ only, the old style icon shouldn't be opened
- does not disable properly when color picker is opened

Name suggestions (currently going with Iconographer, but comments, suggestions, etc. are welcome):
- Iconographer
- Iconolator
- Icon Studio
- Graphicon
- Pixelator/Pixelizer

Future stuff (planned version in parantheses):
- filled rectangle/oval/polygon (photoshop style menu when clicking & hold on tool button?) (1.1)
- split up picture into icons command (1.1/1.5)
- anti-aliasing for line, oval tools (1.5/2.0)
- possible simultaneous editing of icon and mask (goes with anti-aliasing) (1.5/2.0)
- better handling of depths (so that only the ones you use are saved in the final icon) (1.5)
- considering spinning off tools and previews into floating palettes (so there'll be one for all the open editors). (2.0+)
- floater for color palette/picker and tool options (2.0+)
- Effects menu with: Glow, Blur, Shadow, Make Folder Icon (1.1/1.5)
- transformations (at least scaling, possibly others too). (1.5)
- improved icon browser, with finder-style list, options for icon sizes, etc. (1.1)
- 8 bit selections (so that text can be anti-aliased, and dragged data can be placed into a proper selection). (1.1)
- appearance sound support (1.1)
- contextual menus (1.5)
- proxy icons (1.1)
- windows menu (with icons?) (1.1)
- alternative view to icon display (eliminate 48x48 size, and display all the rest at the same, can switch among layouts in preferences) (1.1)
- compressed saved states with run length encoding (1.1)
- screen grab command (1.1)
