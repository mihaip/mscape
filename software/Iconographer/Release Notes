shoulds:
- different centering styles for MAlert
- settable default button for MAlert
- hovering over RGB/HSB slider previews should show color in readout
- readout should show up when in another editor's drawing area
- move palette on screen if not within new screen bounds (when res changes, etc.)
- 8-bit system palette balloon help should explain each section
- don't trying open folders when verying if an icon already exists when doing save into icon
- tinting when dragging and there's a floated selection...

Future stuff (planned version in parantheses):
- loading of file icons when dragged into side display/preview (1.1)
- 8 bit selections (so that text can be anti-aliased, and dragged data can be placed into a proper selection). (1.1)
- screen grab command (1.1)
- .tiff saving (1.1/1.5)
- Effects menu with: Glow, Blur, Shadow, Make Folder Icon (1.1/1.5)
- split up picture into icons command (1.1/1.5)
- transformations (at least scaling, possibly others too). (1.5)
- contextual menus (1.5)
- insertion/saving into .ICL/.DLL files (1.5)
- integration with glypher (1.5)
- transparency controls for tools (1.5/2.0)
- simultaneous editing of icon and mask (goes with anti-aliasing) (1.5/2.0)
- multiple views (2.1/2.5)

todo for 2.1:
- carbon compliance
- anti-aliased text
- palette position snapping
- clicking once with the marquee (and lasso) should deselect
- snap colors in color floater to current palette, system, web, grays, etc.
- better handle converting to windows icon and saving immediately (check datafork, name, etc.)
- redo colors and pattern pop-up (common base, use dialog instead)
- refactor tools so that it can be made more friendly with background processes
- refactor icnseditorclass so that we don't depend on the internals of the icns class
- refactor icnsclass so that we don't statically allocate all members
- refactor icnseditorclass so that we can support the multiple views
- .rsrc files
- preferences and adjust balloon help
- pop-ups should emulate menu behavior (click and release should leave the display open)
- deal with icon and mask not being the same size in icon browser preview
- scale icon up if previewing at a size that isn't available
- when hitting the editor key shortcut, the icon menu should be hilighted
- preference for not hiding floaters when in background
- magnification pop-up slightly off
- handle empty icons better (i.e. don't crash)
