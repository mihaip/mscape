- (multiple) undo support (double linked list?)
(29/12) implemented basic infrastructure, and it works for most basic cases. Still have problems with drag and drop, memory usage/checking
(6/1) fixed some problems with restoring selection contents, which I thought I had previously eliminated

- constrain movement of selection to x/y axis when holding down shift
(30/12) Done, reused code from line constraint (see below)


- when moving a selection beyond the edge of the window allow it to be drag and dropped onto other applications


- when holding down shift constrain line drawing to right angles
(30/12) Done, I actually made it so that it would be constrained at 45 degree intervals, which seems to be the norm in today's drawing applications (Photoshop and Icon Machine do it for example).


- add preview which combines current icon and mask (this should go right underneath the icon and mask displays)
(29/12) Implemented, and it works as requested, except if there is a floating selection it isn't drawn in the preview (fixing this would require having temp GWorlds for the icon and mask to merge with the selection first). Drag and drop from these icons is a possibility, but not required.
(02/01) Added drawing of selections.


- when dragging, don't show a hilite rect if the cursor is over the container that is its source
(2/1) Done


- add option to choose folders, not just files for icon editing


- extract icons from any file, not just ones with custom icons


- when opening a file with more than one icon resource, put up an "Icon Browser" to let the user pick which one to edit (even allow multiple selections, since I can have more than one editor open at the same time?)
(29/12) Made two interface prototypes using REALBasic, and uploaded them for feedback.
(03/01) implemented prototype number 2, and it seems to work pretty well.
(05/01) added special handling of files with 0 and 1 icons
(06/01) found bug at school which caused icon not to be displayed in editor after selecting it from the list, but I can't reproduce it at home


- flip horizontal/vertical and rotate clockwise/counterclockwise (at 90¡) commands
(1/1) Almost done, except might want to center rotated selection on previous one.

- select similar command (depends on how much time I have)


- add a "Icon modified since last save, do you want to save" dialog when closing and quitting (quitting is my chance to add recursion to the app, since I can go through the linked list recursively).


- contextual menu support (unlikely in IB version, probable in final one since the competition (Icon Machine) has it)


- add circle, text drawing, polygon tools


- when dragging a file from the Finder, instead of rejecting the drag take the file's icon and place it (this ties in with getting any file's icon)


- when holding down option and selecting a different bit depth from the menu, transfer the current depth to that depth (most editors do this with drag and drop, but because I implemented 48x48 support too, I don't have the screen space to have all of the on the screen at the same time).

- 68K version (not an issue for IB)


- 8.5 features (proxy icons)?


- importing from .tiff/.xpm files, which are used to store NeXT/UNIX icons (unlikely, unless I can find some libraries to parse the icons)


- GWorld updates: Draw to an external GWorld first, and then copy to the window, so that there will be no flickering when updating (this applies to the icon and mask display, as well as the previews)
