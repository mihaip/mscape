Iconographer 1.0d5
this development release expires on June 15

Please send all feedback to mihai@mscape.com. The main focus of this release is stability, followed by performance (I haven't had a chance to test with older machines yet) and lastly (feature requests). The best thing you can do is try to use Iconographer for all your icon editing needs, so that 1) you can discover any bugs and 2) see if anything doesn't "feel" right. Thanks!

Known (but stubborn) bugs with pre Mac OS 8.5 systems:
- crash when displaying Nav Services dialog
- when opening files that have a custom icon but its 8.5+ only, the old style icon shouldn't be opened
- does not disable properly when color picker is opened

Features which should be in the final 1.0 release:
- optimize lasso...
- nifty scrolling text in about box with all helpful testers :p
- dragging files loads their icons instead of rejecting them
- fix background disabling problems when switching among windows
- help (both balloon and html based)
- reduce flickering in side display (GWorld buffering?)
- preview for labels, etc (need UI for this...)
- use tab to cycle through icon size/depths
- eye dropper should work across editors
