	<P>Iconographer is shareware; it is NOT free. If you use it for more than a few icons you should pay a $15 registration fee. Registrations for Iconographer are handled by the Kagi Shareware service run by Kee Nethery. In addition to cash in various currencies and US dollar checks drawn on US banks, Kagi Shareware also accepts credit card registrations by snail-mail or e-mail (your card number is scrambled). For organizations, they handle invoices and site licenses, too. To register please use the enclosed Register application or <A HREF="http://order.kagi.com/?QEJ">register online</A>. You will receive a registration code from Kagi, and when you enter that and your name in the registration dialog (available from the Apple menu) the reminder will be disabled.</P>
