- fix icon rotation issue with "Toggle Window Size" sample icon
- clear up docs about os x finder's .icns displaying abilities (and other formats)
- saving into yourself with mac os new option when file is .icns causes crash

OPTIMIZATION
- calling UpdatePalettes twice when closing editors

- adjust WNE sleep value when in background, when in TrackMouseLocation, etc.
- look into why isfrontprocess takes so long in memberspalette doidle
- add caching to other palettes too, not just members one
