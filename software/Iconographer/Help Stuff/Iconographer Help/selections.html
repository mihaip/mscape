	<P>A selection can be in two states, either un-floated or floated. When a selection is first made (using the various <A HREF="tools.html">selection tools</A>), it is in the un-floated state. This means that there is nothing "behind" it, that it is still part of the main image. Once a selection is moved, it is floated, that is it can glide above the rest of the image, and can thus be considered to be a separate layer. When moving a previously un-floated selection, a "hole" filled with the background color is left behind in the image. When items are pasted or dragged in, they are placed in floating selections.</P>

	In most graphical programs, once a selection is made, its shape cannot be altered. However, Iconographer gives you much better control over selections. It is possible to add or subtract from a selection, thus greatly easing the process of creating irregular shapes. To add to a selection, hold down shift before using a selection tool. Then the new selection shape will be added to (instead of replacing) the current selection. Similarly, to subtract from a selection, hold down option before using a selection tool. Then the new selection shape will be subtracted from the current selection.
