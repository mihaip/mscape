I get to do this all again on what OS?)   Lisa Marie (no, not that one)   Bob Gaynor (Radio Queen)   Jeff Click (please make it sound cool!)   and of course Greg Landweber...Without the support, ideas, help, and inspirationyou all coughed up (whether you knew it or not),Kaleidoscope 2.0 wouldn't have been as much funto do as it was.
