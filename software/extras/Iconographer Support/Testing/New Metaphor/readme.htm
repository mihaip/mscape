An interface which recalls objects and procedures already familiar to the user gives him an idea of how the system works. Traditionally, operating systems have founded their graphical user interfaces on the metaphor of an office, presenting to us file folders, a "desktop" and even a wastebasket.</font> <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">My ambition was to create an icon set which did not merely beautify the existing metaphor, but instead presented a whole new metaphor. The metaphor I chose was that of a tree. The computer is seen as a tree, with branches instead of folders and leaves in place of documents. Startup is spring, shutdown is fall.</font> <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Being an unfamiliar metaphor, I have opted to include this explanation of some of the icons.</font> <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Keep in mind that I was more interested in creating a new desktop metaphor than accurately representing the biology of a tree.</font> <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Extensions:</b> Potted Soil. During spring (startup), nutrients in the soil (extensions) determine the future strength (capabilities) of the tree (computer).</font> <IMG SRC="expl.gif" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="217" ALIGN="RIGHT"><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Control Panels:</b> Weather. Sun and wind (control panels) shape (customize) the tree (computer) long after it reaches maturity (completes startup).</font> <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Applications:</b> Hose. A device coming from outside the tree (computer) which helps it to produce leaves (documents).</font> <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">To the right is an illustration of Extensions, Control Panels and Applications as they are signified in the New Metaphor.</font> <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Preferences:</b> Faucet. Modifies the hose (applications).</font> <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Locked Folder:</b> Dead Branch. Will hold no more leaves (documents).</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font> <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><b>Internet:</b> Forest. Foreign trees (computers) found in the vicinity (over a network).</font> <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The rest are, I think, easy enough to get.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy this whimsical "paradigm shift for your desktop!"</font> <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">John Marstall</font> <br><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><a href="mailto:jmarstall@socket.net">jmarstall@socket.net</a></font> <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; </body></html>
