IconDraggerVersion 3.2.1 - December 1998IconDragger is an application that will create pictures of icons in a icon pack. The PICT information can be dragged to the desktop or into another application. After an icon is selected, it can also be copied to the clipboard.If you have not registered for IconDropper, you will see a red X across the top of the icon when you drag and release. When you register, the red X and the start up message will go away.As you evaluate the software, make sure that you check out the preferences. There are several options that control the picture and how it's dragged.The icon packs are, by default, are obtained from the same folder that IconDropper uses. Once you place your packs in the Packs folder, they are ready to go with both applications. If you have moved your packs to another folder, you'll need to set up the folder from preferences.Things to Try¥ IconDragger can drag directly into Adobe Photoshop, FileMaker Pro and other applications that support drag-n-drop of PICT data.¥ You can use the copy command of IconDropper (Command-C) to copy the icon into the clipboard. This allows you to use the icons in applications that don't support drag-n-drop. You need to use this method with Director 5.¥ Adjust the preferences to change the size of the picture.¥ Change the fill color for the background. This is useful when you are putting the icons in a document that has a background with a constant color (like a web page).The rest of this file is legal mumbo-jumbo.Copyright and DistributionCopyright © 1997, 1998 by The Iconfactory.
