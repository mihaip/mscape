PIconServices.PIconServices implements refcounted icons, works with IconServices if available, or does it by itself if not.I wanted something like this for a while, but noone else seemed to be writing it..so...It doesn't work as advertised, the CFM shlb I wanted wouldn't compile, said it couldn't find __initialize or __terminate, maybe it is CWPro 3.1 or maybe it is just me.Here is what it does, it calls IconServices if you are compiling a PPC app, and the machine it is running on has IS.If not it implements the same thing itself.Here is a list of implemented routines:PISSInitPISSTerminatePtInPIconRectInPIconPIconToRgnPlotPIcon			UnregisterPIcon										RegisterPIconFromResourceReleasePIcon	AcquirePIconGetPIconOwners		GetPIconFromFile							GetPIconGetPIconFromFolderPIdentifyFolderNote: This library implemented what I wanted from it a while ago, but I got carried away :).There are bugs, I am sure there are many. There are lots of possible improvements you could make,thus the GNU library licence.Have fun,PeterNote just because I have released this as free source doesn't mean I can't beg.You do not have to do any of the folowing:Send me money (by buying something at http://order.kagi.com/?S8ZSend me software ogorman@kagi.comsend me toolssend me bug reports (with fixes)send me bug reports (w/o fixes)give me a job....
