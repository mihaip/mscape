<UL>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Icon Machine's tools and commands
  provide a wide array of possibilities. These are just some of
  the things you can do for effective icon manipulation.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#1e2866" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Copy Family
&amp; Paste Family commands</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">These commands are like copying
  and pasting icons in the Finder; they work on the entire icon
  family at once.If you copy an icon in the Finder, you can use
  the Paste Family command to paste all of the icon types at once.
  Conversely, you can use the Copy Family command and then go to
  the Finder and paste the icon onto an item.</FONT>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">If you want to get icons into
  a resource file, such as a Kaleidoscope scheme, you can use the
  Copy Family command and then paste all of the resources in using
  ResEdit or Resorcerer. This will give you all of the ICN#, icl8,
  etc. types, as well as the all-in-one icns resource. To go the
  other way, you can copy an icns resource and then use Icon Machine's
  Paste Family command.</FONT>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">In the future, Icon Machine
  will be able to save icons directly into resource files, as well
  as read them.</FONT>

Adobe Photoshop</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Icon Machine will read the transparency
  information when you copy or drag from Adobe Photoshop images,
  so you can design your icons in Photoshop and then use Icon Machine
  to do the actual conversion into an icon.</FONT>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Since selections also have transparency,
  you can easily assemble badged folder icons or whatever combination
  you want.</FONT>

      <TD WIDTH="100%" BGCOLOR="#ebd3d3"><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">There
        seems to be a bug in Photoshop that causes it to crash if you
        copy or drag from a black and white icon in Icon Machine and
        try to place it in a Photoshop document. You can work around
        this problem by copying the black and white image to a color
        icon, and then bringing it into Photoshop.</FONT></TD>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#1e2866" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Working with
the Finder</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">When you save an icon, sometimes
  it takes the Finder a few seconds to display your changes.</FONT>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">The Finder uses the 1-bit mask
  (not the 8-bit bask) to determine the shape of the icon, for
  tasks like how much of the screen to redraw when an icon is selected,
  or figuring out if a mouse click is inside an icon. To make sure
  your 32-bit icon will work correctly, make sure that even the
  slightly opaque pixels are covered by opaque pixels in the 1-bit
  mask. If you see strange glitches in your 32-bit icon in the
  Finder, or you can't seem to click on it, you need to adjust
  the 1-bit mask.</FONT>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#1e2866" SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Developing
your own techniques</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Experiment with dragging to
  and dropping from the different parts of the Icon Machine window.
  Once you have become familiar with how they all work together
  you will be able to work more quickly and perhaps achieve some
  effects that you couldn't otherwise do.</FONT>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Sometimes creating a new document
  helps just to give you some temporary extra working space. You
  can use that space to construct an element and then drag it into
  your main icon window, taking advantage of the transparency mask
  so that the compositing comes out right.</FONT>
