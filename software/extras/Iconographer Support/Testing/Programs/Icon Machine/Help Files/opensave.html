<UL>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">The Mac OS lets you change,
  or customize, the icon of almost any file, folder, or disk. Normally
  you would have to create your custom icon in a graphics program
  and then paste it into the Finder's Get Info window, but Icon
  Machine lets you edit custom icons directly.</FONT>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">When Icon Machine opens an item,
  it reads the item's icon, whether it be a custom icon or the
  default icon for that type of item. You can see the item's default,
  or original, icon in the bottom right corner of the editing window.</FONT>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">When you save an icon, Icon
  Machine updates its custom icon (it may take a moment for the
  Finder to show the change). The Apply Icon To command lets you
  select any file, folder, or disk, and Icon Machine will save
  your icon as that item's custom icon.</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1e2866" FACE="Charcoal">The Edit Icon Plugin</FONT></P>

<UL>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">The Edit Icon plugin is a contextual
  menu plugin for PowerPC computers with Mac OS 8 or later. Drag
  the plugin onto your System Folder to install it, and restart
  your computer. Once installed, the Edit Icon plugin will add
  an &quot;Edit Icon&quot; command to the Finder's contextual menus,
  which will open the selected item in Icon Machine.</FONT>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">A contextual menu is a pop-up
  menu that appears when you hold down the control key and click
  on something, giving you quick access to menu commands that apply
  to whatever you clicked on. Icon Machine's own windows also have
  contextual menus; try control-clicking in various parts of the
  window to see what they can do for you.</FONT>
