<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">2.0.1<BR>
</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">- Fixed some selection
and drawing problems that could cause garbage to appear in the
images.<BR>
- Fixed a bug where moving a selection partly offscreen, deselecting,
and undoing would result in a cut-off image in the selection.<BR>
- Clicking on the proxy icon and quickly dragging will now drag
the window, rather than doing nothing.<BR>
- Creating a small 4-bit or 8-bit icon also creates a small B&amp;W
icon if it's not there, to hold the mask.<BR>
- Fixed the bucket tool for image-only mode in 32-bit icons.<BR>
- Fixed problems with selecting folders with Navigation Services.
The window had no title, and the Save Changes dialog didn't appear.<BR>
- Using a contextual menu to delete a 32-bit icon that wasn't
active didn't delete the mask.<BR>
- No more -43 errors when saving the icon of a disk.<BR>
- 32-bit icons previews are drawn dithered for displays that are
not set to millions of colors.<BR>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">2.0</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Geneva"><BR>
- 32-bit icon editing! As a part of this, the window layout has
been rearranged a bit, and the transparency selector has been
added.<BR>
- Changed the way the mask dots are drawn. The new way uses less
memory and is possibly a little faster, and transparent pixels
look more like I want them to (which is more important in 32-bit
icons).<BR>
- Fixed a crash that happened when dragging to icon selectors.<BR>
- Tool tips no longer appear in inactive windows.<BR>
- Icons are no longer read and saved by sending AppleEvents to
the Finder, since this method does not work with 32-bit icons.<BR>
- Option-clicking a color selector button opens the Color Picker.<BR>
- Added the Copy Family and Paste Family commands.<BR>
- Many other minor improvements and bug fixes.</FONT></P>

an icon<BR>

large 16-color icon box<BR>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">1.3.1</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Geneva"><BR>

preview (they were being stretched to large icon size)<BR>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">1.2.1</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"
 FACE="Geneva"><BR>
- When the Other Size dialog was open, you could control-click
in another window to bring it to the front. This has been fixed.
This was a potentially dangerous problem because you could close
the window you were trying to choose a size for, which probably
would have caused a crash.<BR>
- Keyboard shortcuts for the OK and Cancel buttons are recognized
in the Other Size dialog, and the OK button is outlined.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">1.2</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1"

those who ran into this.<BR>
- When you drag an icon clipping onto the member selector, it
will use the contents of the clipping rather than the clipping's
icon (when appropriate).<BR>
- With some icons, dragging an icon from the member selector to
the editing area created a selection with an incorrect mask. This
is fixed.<BR>
- The Edit Icon plugin was modified to keep the &quot;Edit Icon&quot;
string in a resource for easier localization.</FONT></P>
