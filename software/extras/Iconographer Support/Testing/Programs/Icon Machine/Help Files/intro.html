<UL>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Icon Machine is an icon editor-
  it lets you customize the icons of items in the Finder. To edit
  the icon of an item, just drag it onto the Icon Machine icon
  in the Finder, and Icon Machine will open a window in which you
  can edit the icon. When you're done, use the Save command to
  apply your new icon. And there you are.</FONT>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Also, Icon Machine is shareware.
  A paltry 20 bucks. If you decide you like the program and want
  to continue to use it, please pay for it as described at the
  end of this file. If you don't think it's worth $20, just delete
  it from your hard disk and wait around for the next version.
  For more information on how and why to pay, see the <A HREF="shareware.html">Shareware
  and Registration</A> section.</FONT>

Machine?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">When I first started using System
  7 and saw how you could customize icons by pasting them in the
  Finder's Get Info windows, I immediately said, &quot;Hey, what
  we need is an icon editor!&quot; And the idea of Icon Machine
  was born, and has been evolving ever since. Other people have
  made icon editors too, and I have tried out as many as I could
  get my hands on (because if I found one I liked enough it would
  save me a lot of trouble!) but I was never quite satisfied. If
  you want a thing done right....</FONT>

Machine?</FONT></B></P>

<UL>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Well, I think it's pretty cool.
  I tried to make it as useful and usable as possible, and as a
  part of that I have included extensive support for Macintosh
  Drag and Drop. A lot of ideas have come and gone, many of which
  are reserved for upcoming versions of this program. If you have
  any comments or suggestions, I would be overjoyed to hear them.
  Really.</FONT>
