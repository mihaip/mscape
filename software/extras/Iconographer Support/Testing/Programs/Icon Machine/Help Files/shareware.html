  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Icon Machine is shareware. Try
  before you buy; just don't forget to buy! You can register your
  copy for $25 through Kagi Shareware. If you registered a previous
  version of Icon Machine, you can upgrade for $5. The option of
  a site license is also offered; this allows you to use as many
  copies as you need at a particular site. If your company only
  has one site, that's all you need! A site license is $120.</FONT>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Unlike some shareware programs,
  Icon Machine is in no way crippled or restricted before your
  register. The only difference is that once you enter your registration
  code, the About box will no longer appear when the program starts
  up.</FONT>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Using the enclosed Register
  program, fill out your name, how many copies you're registering,
  and your payment method. Then you can print the form and mail
  it, fax the form, or copy and e-mail it. The addresses you need
  will be given in the form itself.</FONT>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">Alternately, you can register
  on the Web at the following address:<BR>
  <A HREF="help://order.kagi.com/?2YD">http://order.kagi.com/?2YD</A></FONT>
  <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Geneva">When you register, you will
  receive a confirmation by e-mail, and a registration code will
  also be mailed to you separately.</FONT>
