ÊDS now saves and copies all cicn resources, if you are registered or not.Unregistered copies of DS no longer quit after 30 minutes.Added text to several previews.Added a cursor editor. It works just like the cicn editor, sans resizing. Cursors must be 16x16. To set the hot spot of the cursor, command-option click on the pixel which you would like to be the new hot spot. The hot spot is designated by an "X" drawn on the hot spot pixel, using the inverse of the pixel's color.Much enhanced drag and drop code. Very much.All of the palette windows now remember where they were placed from session to session. If a window is moved partially offscreen, it will be placed in its default location for the next session.If a resource has a name, that name will be used in the resource id popup instead of the default name. This is because some resources changed function from Kaleidoscope 1.8 to Kaleidoscope 2.Clicking and not dragging a selection in the editor will result in the selection being deselected.A new feature in the preferences: "Constrain Slides to 8-bit". Previously, this option was always on. Turning it off allows the sliders to handle resources which use colors outside the standard 256 system colors better. While previewing the slide, it will still be shown in the standard 256 colors, because without the constraint, the slide takes more time.A slight bit of animation in the palette window to liven things up.If you don't have a "Kaleidoscope Color Schemes" folder in your Extensions folder, the "Open K Schemes Folder" in the open dialog will use the folder containing your active Kaleidoscope scheme.-----Designer's Studio 1.6© 1997 - 1998 Akamai DesignTom Connolly And Dorian Weisel
