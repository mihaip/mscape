     If you want NeoIcon s ability to drag and drop an icon, and you had an older version of NeoIcon , then you must rebuild your desktop.  To do that, just hold down the [option], and [open apple] button at the same time at start-up until your Mac asks you if you want rebuild your desktop.  Click Yes.Easy instructions from Brad.     If any problems arise with NeoIcon , please contact me at maxmac@aol.com.
