However, Power Mac users can output GIF files directly from the Icon Archiver by using the bundled Clip2gif Link plugin.• The Clip2gif Link plugin is a special PowerPC-only plugin that uses Yves Piguet’s clip2gif freeware utility to export the icon files. To use this plugin you must download clip2gif separately from any of the usual online sources (like the info-mac archives) and install it as follows:  1- Move the clip2gif folder to the folder where you want to keep it.  2- Make an alias to the clip2gif application.  3- Move the alias into the "Archiver Plugins" folder.  4- Rename the alias so that it is named "clip2gif".(as an alternative, you can move the clip2gif application itself into the "Archiver Plugins" folder and rename it as "clip2gif").• The Clip2gif link lets you generate GIF, JPEG and TIFF files, but it only works on PowerPC machines and requires a specific version of clip2gif (earlier or later versions can’t be used).• To contact the author of clip2gif, write to Yves Piguet at <piguet@ia.epfl.ch>.
