The 8-bit collection carried 1,000 large andsmall 8-bit color icons. The black & white one included10,000 large black & white icons. None of the collectionshad any duplicate icons.* File sizes for Icon Archiver and StuffIt 5.0:32-bit:  Custom icons folder               1,208 K         Folder compressed with StuffIt      472 K         Icon Archiver archive               374 K         Archive compressed with StuffIt     371 K8-bit:   Custom icons folder               3,810 K         Folder compressed with StuffIt    1,199 K         Icon Archiver archive               866 K         Archive compressed with StuffIt     854 KB&W:     Custom icons folder               5,683 K         Folder compressed with StuffIt    3,673 K         Icon Archiver archive             1,297 K         Archive compressed with StuffIt     928 KNote: the disk space used by a folder full of custom iconsis generally larger than the actual size of the icons; forexample, the b&w collection used 9.7 MB on an HFS+ volumeand even more on a large HFS volume.Notes about the different storage formats* Custom Icons folder:  The icons are directly shown by the Finder,  but opening and scrolling the window can be very slow.  Saving a large number of small files to disk makes the  disk catalog grow (slowing down disk recovery programs)  and wastes a lot of storage space on larger HFS disks.  No more than a few hundred icons can be stored in one  folder, or the Finder stops working properly.* Custom Icons folder, compressed with StuffIt:  The icons must be decompressed before they are visible  (which can take a long while on slower machines),  and then they have the same problems described above.  Compressing a single folder containing too many icons gets  slower and slower (even on a Power Mac) as the number of  icons increases over a few hundred items.* Icon Archiver archive:  The Archiver stores the icon data in a special compressed format  that allows it to decompress each icon's image on the fly when  needed; the archive opens very quickly even when it contains a  very large number of icons, and all icons are immediately visible.  The compression method is a lot more efficient than StuffIt's  because it is specifically optimized for icon storage.* Icon Archiver archive, compressed with StuffIt:  The data format used by the Icon Archiver is so tight that  further compressing an archive is really hard. However,  compressing Archiver archives with StuffIt allows you to  verify the data integrity when decompressing the archive  and avoid unwanted modifications, which makes it the best  solution for long-term icon storage.
