Icon Archiver archives are now smaller than StuffIt files.- Supported icon types include 32-bit and 48x48 pixels huge icons.- Additional list views and options were added to display the new icons.- Individual icon comments are now available.- Icons can be sorted by icon identity (faster) or similarity (slower).- New commands include Trim To Selection, selective Add and Remove Sizes, smart Picture Conversion options and more.- Sorting icons now flags an archive as modified.- Icon names are no longer truncated to 24 characters.- The Archiver starts up much faster when connected to a network.- The Windows ICO plugin now correctly generates 16x16 and 48x48 icons.- Many other improvements were made, including better error reporting, smarter menu commands and more...Version 3.0- Icons can now be rearranged at will inside an archive by simply dragging them around.- You can now add comments to an archive as well as a copyright string that’s shown at the bottom of the window. Note that the new archive format can’t be read by older versions of the Archiver.- Family views! You can now see all 6 members of each icon family in your archive windows.- A status icon tells you if the archive was changed and if it’s got a comment or copyright string. Clicking on the icon displays the archive information window, option-clicking on it lets you edit the comments.- You can now stick icons on Finder items directly from archive windows. The Sticker window is still there for historical reasons, but it’s no longer necessary. To stick a custom icon on any Finder item, simply hold down the Command key while dragging it on an archive window and drop it onto the desired icon.- Inverted the meaning of Command-drag and simple drag in the Sticker window to make it consistent with archive windows.- Added the “Grab Finder Icon Only” option: this grabs the icon from Finder items by using Apple Events rather than scanning all their resources. Only the actual Finder icon is copied, and the exact file name is used. This allows you to add non-resource icons such as disk icons to archive windows. Note that some icons may not be copied because the Finder doesn’t allow it. For example, you can’t grab the Trash icon by dropping it on an archive window, but you can still retrieve it from the System file.- Holding down the Control key while dropping an item into an archive window temporarily inverts the “Grab Finder Icon Only” option. Since Mac OS 8 uses the Control key for contextual menus, you should only press it after the drag has already been started.- The new “Add Missing Sizes” command lets you add all missing family members to the selected icons. For example, if a given icon only has large 8-bit and 1-bit images, this command will add the large 4-bit icon and the three small icons.- A new Windows menu helps when working with multiple archives.- A new Windows .ICO export plugin makes it easy to transfer icons to Windows PCs.- You can now insert icons at any position when dragging from an archive window to another.- Copy/Paste and Drag from an archive window to another now preserves the custom order that the icons had in the source window.- When running out of memory while scanning files and folders, you can now try and compact the archive by removing any duplicates rather than saving and emptying it. The old choices (stop scanning, save & continue) are still there.- The archive window is now updated while the scan takes place. The status bar is updated every two seconds, the icons every ten seconds to avoid wasting too much time in useless redraw operations. Any newly created archive windows are now displayed at the beginning of the scan rather than at the end.- Added the “Stick Minimized Icon” option. This makes the Archiver stick a modified icon family where the large icon is copied from the small one, thus providing a small icon even in large icon view. Many people use this kind of minimized icons for files and aliases on the desktop, to preserve their desktop space.- Added a new “Skip Sort Warning” option for people who don’t care about preserving their custom icon ordering.- The new 3D look makes the Archiver more Mac OS 8-like.Version 2.3- The Sticker window now supports the new MacOS 8 Finder. Added "Revert To Saved", "Select Duplicates" and "Get Info" commands. The Icon Info window now displays an icon image for each member of the icon family.Version 2.2- The Archiver can now export custom icons as folders.Version 2.1- Switched to Kagi for shareware registrations. Added a new export plugin to create Kid Pix stamps and an option to ignore resource names. Archive corruption should no longer occur when other applications crash, and more archive recovery capabilities were added. The Display Manager is now supported, so that all windows are automatically moved onscreen when you change your monitor’s resolution on the fly. Fixed a couple of minor things in my application framework, and recompiled with the latest version of the CodeWarrior.Version 2.0- The Archiver now supports external plugins that let you export your icons in many useful graphics formats including PICT, PNG, cicn, GIF, JPEG and TIFF (see the documentation for more details). Keyboard navigation of the icon lists is now implemented, so you can use the arrow keys or type an icon’s name to select it. Added basic archive recovery capabilities to resurrect some corrupted archives, typically those broken by a system crash that prevented the disk cache from being properly flushed to disk; hold down the Option key when choosing Open from the File menu to enable archive recovery. Added compatibility modes for System versions that cause the Archiver to crash; hold down the Option or Control key when launching the Archiver to manually disable some of its features.Version 1.0.2- The new Icon Dearchiver utility is now included in the package. Pasting or dragging pictures into an Archiver window can now split the image in multiple solid-background icons, which can then easily be dragged to the Finder to build cool multi-icon images directly inside the Finder windows.Version 1.0.1- Double-clicking an open archive now selects the appropriate window instead of displaying an error code; now reads 'ICN#' names even if “skip b&w icons” is checked; opens an empty archive window when launched alone; more careful checks should avoid launching crashes when the Drag Manager is installed on pre-7.1 systems; fixed a bug that could cause the “Don’t Save” button to be automatically pressed.Version 1.0- First public release after months of beta testing.
