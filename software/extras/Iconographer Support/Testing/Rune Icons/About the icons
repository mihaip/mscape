Rune Iconsby Feòrag NicBhrìdeIntroductionHere are a couple of dozen 32-bit icons of runes I produced while experimenting with Mihai Parparita’s excellent clip2icns (http://www.mscape.com/). These icons can only be used under MacOS 8.5 or later.So what’s it going to cost?Nowt. But if you happen to be in the Edinburgh area, a pint or two (in the Holyrood Tavern) always goes down well with me. Otherwise support a small independent brewery or microbrewery on my behalf.You done any more of these?I have a couple of packages of good, old-fashioned icons available via my web site. Here you will also find my fonts and some desktop patterns.Feòrag NicBhrìdehttp://www.antipope.org/feorag/freestuff/e-mail:feorag@antipope.orgsnail:89 Brunswick StreetEdinburgh EH7 5HSScotland
