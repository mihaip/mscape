Icon->.ICO Source

This source was written and compiled with Metrowerks CodeWarrior and
uses Metrowerks' PowerPlant application framework. If you want to build
the program as it stands, you'll need the PowerPlant source and assorted
resources and libraries. Pretty much all the requisite files are included
in the PowerPlant Appearance project stationery, so start from there and
then add anything that's missing.

If you want to use the icon handling classes in a non-PP project, you'll
need to provide alternative File & Stream implementations. I *think*
the classes should otherwise be fairly PP-independent, but it's a long time
since I examined the code in detail, so I could be wrong.

The code structure is not exactly elegant: the translation stuff is
a batch-processing hack, with a feeble excuse for a UI clumsily bolted on
as an afterthought. But there should be enough comments to just about work
out what's going on.

Conversion from Windows .ICO files to Mac icon resources has been left
unaddressed for two main reasons. First, parsing an .ICO file is a bit
tedious. Second, while Mac icons all use the same Mac system palettes,
Windows icons all have their own palettes, so the colour indices would
have to be remapped to their closest approximations, or perhaps even
dithered. Neither of these considerations is prohibitive, but they're
enough to deter a lazy person who doesn't have any real use for such a
converter anyway.

Needless to say, all the source code is copyright (c)1997-1999
Matthew Caldwell (except for any bits which are copyright
MetroWerks). You are free to use any of it in any of your own
projects, provided you include a credit and send me a copy of the
resulting program (or tell me where I can download one if it's a
large file). If you find and/or fix any bugs in the code, please
send me the details so that I can incorporate them into the codebase.

Enjoy.
