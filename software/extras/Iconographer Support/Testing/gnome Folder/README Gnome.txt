-Gnome SCHEME-
[GNu Object Manipulation Environment] OS
It runs on Linux, looks beautiful, and not very many folks have
heard of it. The icon are madeup, and NOT a direct port over...
as far as i know.


NOTE: This scheme is best used with Microangelo, and Any Folder.

Also included are system "file type" icons, which is a little more complex.
To use these effectively, simply click on "view" (which is on almost any 
window), and select "options..."
Now select the tab "File Types" - - and then select a file type
who's icon you wish to change.
This list may help you properly place each icon has it is intended:

*CHANGE ONLY THE ICONS IN "FILE TYPES", TAMPERING WITH ANY OTHER DATA CAN DAMAGE YOUR REGISTRY*

^Dont be scared of this warning, just use common sense....and then you are set.
