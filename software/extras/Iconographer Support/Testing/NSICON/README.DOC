ABOUT NEOSOFT ICON EDITOR
-------------------------

NeoSoft's Icon Editor is quite possibly the best, most
comprehensive utility available for creating and editing Windows
ICO format icons. Extensive tools include: brush, line, circle,
rectangle, flood fill, rotate, flip, area select, text, nudge and
zoom. Transparent areas may be easily painted onto the icon image
to allow background colors to show through. NeoSoft Icon Editor
easily works with multiple icons at the same time for easy cut and
paste between images. These powerful functions and NeoSoft's easy-
to-use interface make painting your own icon-sized pictures a snap!
The NeoSoft Icon Editor imports BMP format bitmapped images and
even imports icons contained within Windows program EXE and DLL
files. Also features context-sensitive help, undo and Windows
clipboard support. Requires Windows 3.1 or higher. Windows 95
compatible. $24.95 + S&H


------------------------------
INSTALLING NEOSOFT ICON EDITOR
------------------------------

Before you can begin using NeoSoft Icon Editor you must run the
NeoSoft Icon Editor Setup program from Windows. In most cases you
cannot simply copy the software onto your hard drive. The files on
the NeoSoft distribution disks are stored in a special compressed
form to save space. The Setup program is the only way to insure
that NeoSoft Icon Editor is properly unpacked and installed. To
install NeoSoft Icon Editor, follow the steps below:

    NOTE: Depending on where you obtained your copy of this
    program, you may not need to run Setup - so don't panic if
    you can't find it. If you have a file named NSICON.EXE, you
    basically have the entire program. Just copy that file to
    your hard drive in a directory of your choice and launch it
    from the Windows Program Manager, File Manager or Windows 95
    Explorer.

1.  Start Windows.

2.  If you received NeoSoft Icon Editor on diskette, place it into
    the floppy drive now. If you downloaded NeoSoft Icon Editor in
    archived format, use PKUNZIP to uncompress the files to a
    working directory on your hard disk.

3.  Activate the Windows Program Manager.

4.  Select "Run..." from the Program Manager's "File" menu. If you
    are using Windows 95, the "Run" option can be selected from the
    "Start" menu.

5.  In the "Command Line" field enter one of the following:

      -  If you placed the NeoSoft Icon Editor diskette into drive
         A:, type: A:\SETUP

      -  If you placed the NeoSoft Icon Editor diskette into drive
         B:, type: B:\SETUP

      -  If you downloaded the NeoSoft Icon Editor, type:
         C:\DIRNAME\SETUP (Remember to replace DIRNAME with the name
         of the directory where you uncompressed the NeoSoft Icon
         Editor's files.)

6.  Follow the instructions on the screen.

CUSTOMER SERVICES & TECHNICAL SUPPORT
-------------------------------------

NeoSoft provides its registered software customers with free
technical support. We also provide limited technical support to
persons evaluating our products during the 30 day evaluation
period.

We do, however, strongly encourage people to register. Software
development and support is very expensive and we need your help if
we are to continue to provide quality programs at affordable
prices. If you haven't already, please take a few moments to
register. This will assure you of eligibility for technical
support, product update notification, special discounts, new
product announcements, etc.

However, if you are experiencing problems, please contact our
technical support department so that we can solve your problem
BEFORE you register. Registration may solve many problems but it
does not always endow the program with features and functions that
do not exist.
