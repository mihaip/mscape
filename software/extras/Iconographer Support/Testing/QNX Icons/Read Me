These QNX icons are ResEdit files (Macintosh).  They're based on the QNX/ Photon operating system interface and were adapated from online jpegs (http://www.qnx.com/amiga/delivering.html).  

Any copyright queries relating to these icons should be addressed to me at:

Please don't go using these icons for anything other than personal desktop use.  I don't really mind people using them as graphics for web pages, as long as the sites aren't commercial.  There's always the possibility the Amiga people will come kick your arse as well as mine...

Windows users:  sorry, no Windows versions of these icons are available on the Saffron Graphics site.  I'll look into the possibility of making some eventually.
