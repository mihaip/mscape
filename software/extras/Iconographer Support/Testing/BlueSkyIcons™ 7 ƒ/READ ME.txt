Sorry for the hard line position, but I'm damn tired of seeing the icons end up piecemeal in various Win icon archives or being sold on commercial CD's without authorization. I do not attribute the abuse to Windows users per se, but rather human nature...and there happens to be more humans using Windows than Mac. (Go figure). Do not e-mail me for special permission. All of the above applies to Linux or any OS other than Mac.The UNEDITED icons may be used as web buttons on PERSONAL, NON-COMMERCIAL web pages. No need to ask permission, but please give a credit and link to Blue Sky Heart Graphics. If you have a "clip-art" type of site, please do NOT use the icons and do not link to me.You may NOT edit or alter these images, unbundle these images from their original sets or distribute these images in any form other than in their original archives. The name "BlueSkyIcons" is a trademark of Blue Sky Heart Graphics. CD distributors, request permission first.Ê					___________________________________________________________________________32-bit icons for Mac OS 8.5+. This is my first attempt at 32-bit icons, which take advantage of the expanded color palette in 8.5 and later. If you're using 8.5+, you'll see the icons as intended, with the extended color palette and smooth edges. If you're using pre-OS 8.5, you're seeing the 8-bit versions. These are not "up to par" with the 32-bitters, and the results are limited colors, jagged edges on some, or a black square encompassing the icon. The square is mainly because of the masking differences or capabilities between the two versions.The icons are in ResEdit format. If you're new to the Mac, here's how to use them: Select the icon you like, Get Info from the File menu in the Finder. Click on the upper left image and Copy from the Edit menu. Close the window, scratch your left ear. Now Select the icon you want replaced by the new icon, Get Info, Click on the upper left image and Paste from the Edit menu. Close the window, behold your new desktop toy.Photoshop was used for creating the images, and Iconographer (http://www.mscape.com) for editing the icons. Iconographer is probably the best icon editor around; it features some Photoshop-like features such as a gradient tool, extended selection capabilities, hue/saturation/brightness/contrast editing, anti-aliasing and dithering. Shareware, only $15.Ê																					__________________________________________________Contact:          	layne@blueskyheart.com	layne@kagi.com	AOL:LayneKarWeb Site: 	http://www.blueskyheart.com	¥ Schemes, Icons, Desktop pictures  ¥ Custom Graphics															____________________________________________________																																								BlueSkyIcons 7																																				© 2000 Layne Karkruff 																																					 Blue Sky Heart Graphics ª 																																					Original Release: 4/10/00
