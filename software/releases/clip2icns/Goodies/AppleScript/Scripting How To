Using AppleScript with clip2icnsby Mihai Parparitapart of the clip2icns packagemihai@mscape.comhttp://www.mscape.com/Introductionclip2icns is now scriptable, thus allowing you to automate the inserting action. When used in conjuction with other programs (such as Adobe Photoshop, and its actions) it allows you to crank out icons in no time.UsageIn addition to the standard AppleScript commands (open, print (which doesn't do anything), run and quit), clip2icns supports a new function, insert. It allows you to insert the clipboard contents into a file of your choice. It takes as its parameters the file into which icons should be inserted, and optionally the ID that the icon should be inserted into and  the name of the icon resource that is to be created. Here is the AppleScript dictionary entry:insert: Inserting the clipboard contents into an icon	insert		into  alias  -- location of the file		[with ID  integer]  -- ID to insert to, if not present then a dialog will appear		[with name  string]  -- name of the icon, if left out the default name for the ID will be usedNotesThe script will return an error of type -100 if there isn't anything in the clipboard to insert.
