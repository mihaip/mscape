Future stuff:
- anti-aliasing for line, oval tools
- possible simultaneous editing of icon and mask
- better handling of depths (so that only the ones you use are saved in the final icon)
- considering spinning off tools and previews into floating palettes
  (so there'll be one for all the open editors).
- floater for color palette/picker and tool options
- simple effects such as blurs, shadows and glows
- transformations (at least scaling, possibly others too).

Name suggestions:
- Iconographer
- Iconolator
- Icon Studio
- Graphicon
- Pixelator/Pixelizer

Bugs in pre 8.5:
- crash when dragging/copying (anything that uses PixMapToPicture)
- crash when displaying Nav Services dialog
- not importing icons with no icl8 (but with icl4) properly


Remaining to be implemented:
- file icons
- new name/icon/about box
- drag from drawing area
- split up picture into icons command
- optimize lasso...
- dragging from photoshop into preview area creates a whole icon set
- fix background disabling problems when switching among windows
