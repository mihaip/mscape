Iconographer 1.0d7
this development release expires on September 1

Please send all feedback to mihai@mscape.com. The main focus of this release is stability, since it'll be the final development release, and hopefully beyond this point no more features will be added, and instead the whole product will be polished. If you're getting sick of the registration reminders, here is the beta tester serial code:

Name: Beta Tester
Registration code: PP271678

I'd like to have a little Goodies/Showcase folder with some icons showing off the new features of the format. If you have anything which you feel would be appropriate, please send it in.

Known Bugs:
- background disabling problems when switching among windows
- garbage on right side when dragging diagonal gradient to huge size
- when using click there it is, dragging save dialog doesn't work (snaps back to original position)
