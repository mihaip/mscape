Iconographer 1.0d6
this development release expires on July 1

Please send all feedback to mihai@mscape.com. The main focus of this release is stability, followed by performance (I can get only intermittent access to a 6100 otherwise I'm on a G3) and lastly feature requests. The best thing you can do is try to use Iconographer for all your icon editing needs, so that 1) you can discover any bugs and 2) see if anything doesn't "feel" right. Thanks!

I'll be leaving for Stanford on June 19, and it'll probably take me a few days to settle in. So if I don't respond immediately to e-mail during that period, now you know why.

The next release will include a beta tester registration code...

I'd like to have a little Goodies/Showcase folder with some icons showing off the new features of the format. If you have anything which you feel would be appropriate, please send it in.

Issues pre Mac OS 8.5 systems:
- when opening files that have a custom icon but its 8.5+ only, the old style icon shouldn't be opened

Kaleidoscope Bugs:
- does not disable properly when color picker is opened

Things which should be in the final 1.0 release:
- dragging files in side display/editing area loads their icons instead of rejecting them
- fix background disabling problems when switching among windows
- performance checks
- clean up prefs dialog (any suggestions for other things which should go in?)
- better out of memory checking

Release notes:
1.0d6
- balloon help everywhere
- paste into selection command, scales clipboard contents to current selection size  
- HTML based help (drag Iconographer Help folder to Help folder in System Folder, and then open up the Help Center if you want searching and help menu to work), feedback wanted (if your name isn't listed in the testers paragram in the Program Info section, well, that's because you weren't much of a tester, so now's your change to remedy that :p)
- now works with system 7.5.3 and above (with the appearance manager installed)
- dithering option in preferences
- lasso now tightens through the background color, not just white
- the eraser's brush size is now 2 x 2
- checking to make sure the 8 bit and 1 bit masks are synced (option in prefs to turn off)
- pixel grid (option in the preferences)
- the preview now displays the current icon/mask on two backgrounds, clicking on them toggles the selected state 
- double clicks on tools for shortcuts:
	marquee: select all
	lasso: lasso all
	eraser: erase all/erase selection
	rectangle/oval/polygon: toggle between framed and filled modes
	gradient: toggle between linear and radial modes
- undo/redo restores the popup selection too
- tab toggles between the current icon and mask
- much better handling (both saving and loading) of icons which do not contain some depths or sizes
- improved previewing in icon browser for icons with no huge size, etc.
- icon browser now updates properly when put in the background and brought back
- removed flickering in side display and preview
- navigation services now works with pre Mac OS 8.5 systems
- the saved states are now compressed, they take up between 6 and 2 times less memory (depending on the complexity of the drawing).
- each open editor takes up 4K less of memory
- the extra space that surrounded the 32 x 32 size has been eliminated (instead, the window is enlarged when switching to the 48 x 48 size)
- if the icon only contains certain sizes (eg. no huge), then the preview area does not reserve space for the sizes which do not exist
- the flash of garbage characters in the status bar when making a new editor has been removed
- dragging from drawing area now works even if the editor isn't in the top left corner
- filling with same color in 8 bits does not crash anymore
- eye dropper now works across editors
- copying down the 8 bit mask into the 1 bit one doesn't attempt to dither, it generates a new 1-bt mask
