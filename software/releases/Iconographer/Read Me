Appearance Manager (built-in with Mac OS 8.0 and up)

Iconographer attempts to follow all of the established Mac OS human interface guidelines. If previous you have used any graphics editor, you should be familiar with the manner in which Iconographer operates.

If you wish to obtain more details on how to operate Iconographer, a detailed on-line help is available. It can be accessed both through the Help menu within the application (refer to the instructions below on how to enable this feature), or simply by double-clicking on the Help alias within the application's folder.

In order to enable searching of the help, access from the Help menu and from the Help Center, the Iconographer Help folder must be placed inside the Help folder which resides inside your System Folder.
