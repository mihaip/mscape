	<P>The preferences (found under the Edit menu) allow you to control some features of Iconographer. Below is a description of each one of them.</P>


<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Default zoom level: </B></FONT> This setting determines the magnification level at which editors will be opened. You can still change the zoom level for each editor individually, but if you find yourself zoomed in a lot for all of the icons you open, you might want to bump up this setting.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Show pixel grid: </B></FONT> Enabling this option (it is off by default) shows a thin grid between the magnified pixels. It is useful when you are counting pixels, since the separation makes it much easier to see where pixels (even of the same color) start and end.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Check sync between 8-bit and 1-bit masks: </B></FONT> If enabled, this option makes sure that the 8-bit and 1-bit masks match up. If they don't, a kind of "pixel build-up" can occur when an icon is selected.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Dither when copying down to lower depths: </B></FONT> This option dithers images when they are copied down to lower bit depths (for example, for 32-bits to 8-bits). Dithering is the use of a pattern to simulate colors.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Generate old-style icons: </B></FONT> When enabled, the icons that Iconographer saves will contain be both in the new Mac OS 8.5 format, and in the old-style format used by previous versions of the Mac OS.</P>
<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Startup Options: </B></FONT> This set of radio buttons allows you to determine what action Iconographer will perform on start-up. By default it creates a new, empty, icon, but it can also be made to automatically select an icon to open, or simply stay open and do nothing.</P>
