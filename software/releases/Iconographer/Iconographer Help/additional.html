	<P>Iconographer supports a set of simple transformations that can be applied to the current icon or selection. All of them can be access from the <B>Transform</B> sub-menu under the <B>Edit</B> menu. The first set of transformations are rotations. They rotate the current icon or selection 90 degrees in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. The next set of commands deal with horizontal and vertical flips. They mirror the image across the Y and X axes respectively. Finally, the Invert command changes the color to it's complement (e.g. blue becomes yellow, and vice-versa).</P>

<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE="4" COLOR="#993300"><B>Color Adjustments</B></FONT>
<UL>
	<FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">
	<P>Iconographer allows you to perform various color adjustments to the current icon or selection. You can change the hue and saturation, in addition to the brightness and contrast. All of these commands are accessed from the <B>Adjust</B> command, under the <B>Edit</B> menu. You can use the sliders to change any of the parameters. In addition, there is a checkbox, <B>Real-time preview</B>, which allows you to see the results while you're moving the sliders, instead of just at the end.</P>
	<P>Hue is the color of the image. By changing the hue, you are effectively shifting the colors across the spectrum. The saturation of the image is the purity of the color, with gray being the least saturated, and the color at 100% intensity being the most saturated. In addition, there is a colorize checkbox, which allows you to replace all of the colors in the icon or selection with the ones specified in the hue slider.</P>
	<P>The contrast of the image is the ratio between the brightest and darkest areas in an image. So, increasing the contrast increases this ratio, thus making the differences between dark and light areas more apparent. Brightness, as its name suggests, is the overall intensity of an image, so a very bright image would appear to be washed out while one with a low brightness would be dark.</P>

<UL>
	<FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">
	<P>In addition to using the color swatch in the icon editor window, Iconographer supports another color picking method. A floating colors palette can be shown (and hidden) from the Windows menu. This palette contains a set of color swatch for selecting between the foreground and background colors, two readouts for the cursor's position and color with respect to the current icon, and a set of color pickers:</P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>RGB (Red, Green, Blue):</B></FONT> This is a standard set of red, green and blue sliders. By varying the intensity of each color, additional tones can be obtained (e.g. red and green to the maximum result in yellow). To ease this mixing process, a preview well is placed beneath each slider. These previews show the effect of moving the sliders to that position</P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value):</B></FONT> Another standard color picker, this one presents you with a set of hue, saturation and value sliders. The hue controls the overall shade of the color. The saturation the amount of "color" (that is, saturation runs from neutral gray through pastel to saturated colours). Value represents the lightness of the color. Each of the HSV sliders also have a preview beneath them.</P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>System palette:</B></FONT> This picker presents the standard system palette for the current depth and platform. In the case of the Mac OS 8-bit system picker, it is divided in such a way to present the 6x6x6 color cube, standard RGB and gray ramps and Apple Icon Colors that are present in the palette.</P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Favorites palette:</B></FONT> This picker is made up of slots where you can place your favorite colors for later use. Simply click on an empty slot, and the current color will be placed in it. To delete a color, command click.</P>
