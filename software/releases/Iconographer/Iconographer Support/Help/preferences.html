	<P>The preferences (found under the Edit menu) allow you to control some features of Iconographer. They are divided into three categories: general, defaults, and external editing. Below are descriptions of each one of them.</P>
	</FONT>
</UL>

<A NAME="general">
<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE="3" COLOR="#993300"><B>General</B></FONT>
<UL>
	<FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">

	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Show only loaded members: </B></FONT>By default, the members palette will display all of the members that the current format supports. Enabling this option limits it to the members contained in an icon that is opened.</P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Check masks when saving: </B></FONT> If <A HREF="iconbasics.html#masks">masks</A> are created incorrectly, it is possible for the icon to not display as desired when you view it in the Finder. This setting enables Iconographer to check the masks and optionally, if errors are found, to fix them.</P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Dither at lower depths: </B></FONT> This option dithers images when they are copied down to lower bit depths (for example, for 32-bits to 8-bits). Dithering is the use of a pattern to simulate colors.</P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Save extra information with icons: </B></FONT> Embeds additional info with the icons that Iconographer saves that includes the current tool, currently selected member, magnification, etc. This allows you to have a consistent editing session whenever working on that icon.</P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Startup options: </B></FONT> This set of radio buttons allows you to determine what action Iconographer will perform on start-up. By default it creates a new, empty, icon, but it can also be made to automatically select an icon to open, or simply stay open and do nothing.</P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Members palette display: </B></FONT> The members palette usually displays it's contents at their natural size. However, if an icon contains many of them, and the screen area is limited, it becomes rather tedious to scroll between members. This option allows you to scale them down so that they take up less space (this is purely an aesthetic modification, the actual contents of the icon are not modified in any way).</P>

	</FONT>
</UL>

<A NAME="defaults">
<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE="3" COLOR="#993300"><B>Defaults</B></FONT>
<UL>
	<FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">
	
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Default zoom level: </B></FONT> This setting determines the magnification level at which editors will be opened. You can still change the zoom level for each editor individually, but if you find yourself zoomed in a lot for all of the icons you open, you might want to bump up this setting.</P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Default icon format: </B></FONT> This setting determines the format of newly created icons, as well as the default selection in the open and save dialogs. </P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Default members: </B></FONT> Although the members of an icon can be set on a case by case basis using the <A HREF="otherpalettes.html#members">info</A> dialog, this option allows you to globally set it for all new icons.</P>

<A NAME="externalediting">
<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE="3" COLOR="#993300"><B>External Editing</B></FONT>
<UL>
	<FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">
	
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>External editor: </B></FONT> Clicking on this button allows you to select the application you wish to use as your external editor.</P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Editor key shortcut:</B></FONT> To make it easier to toggle between Iconographer and the external editor, a hot-key is supported. To set this hot key, click on the button and simulatenously press all of the keys you wish to use.</P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Export format:</B></FONT> To transfer the icon data to the editor, Iconographer must create a temporary file with the chosen format. Please note that not all applications may support all formats.</P>
	<P><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Export icon and mask:</B></FONT> If you wish to simulatenously edit the icon and mask, enable this option. The mask will be displayed as an alpha channel to the document.</P>
	<P>For more information on using the external editor function, please see the section on <A HREF="otherprograms.html#externaleditors">working with other programs</A>.
