	<FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">
	<P>There are several possible causes for this:</P>
	<UL><FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="#993300"><B>Mac OS X</B></FONT> takes much longer than usual to update files whose icons you have just modified. If you'd rather not wait, you can either save the icon into a new file or log out from the Finder and back in.</FONT></UL>
	<UL><FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="#993300"><B>The right format</B></FONT> is also very important. Versions of the Mac OS previous to 8.5 cannot show Mac OS New icons. Additionally, despite expectations to the contrary, the Mac OS X Finder cannot display icons saved in the Mac OS X format (.icns format). In general, saving in the Mac OS Universal (or Mac OS New if pre-8.5 support is not important) is best way to ensure that your icons will be displayed. Finally, icons need to have the right ID (set in the info dialog); the Finder looks for icons with the ID -16455 (which Iconographer normally sets by default).</FONT></UL>
	<UL><FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2"><FONT COLOR="#993300"><B>The right members</B></FONT> are also required for an icon to be displayed. In addition to the basics (an icon and a mask) Mac OS 9.x/8.x also need an 8-bit member even if you have provided a 32-bit one. Also, certain sizes may not be enough, e.g. the Finder cannot display an icon if all you provide is the thumbail one; the large one should be included as well.</FONT></UL>

<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE="4" COLOR="#993300"><B>How do I open the .dmg file that I got when I downloaded Iconographer X?</B></FONT>
<UL>
	<FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">
	<P>The file you see is a disk image that can be opened with Disk Copy under Mac OS X. If you are trying to open this file under Mac OS 8.x/9.x, you should be downloading the Classic version instead.</P>
