clip2cicn 1.0b2by Mihai Parparitamihai@mscape.comhttp://cafe.ambrosiasw.com/gui-central/Beta ReleaseThis is a beta release which expires on July 7, 1998. The newest version is always available from the address above. Although I have tried to get all the bugs out chances are that a few might have sneaked past me so always use this on a copy of your scheme. I'm not responsible for any damage done to your system, computer, etc. Bug reports and suggestions for future releases should be sent to the address above.IntroductionThis little utility is designed to help those of you working on Kaleidoscope 2.0 schemes that don't use the system palette. It inserts a picture from the clipboard, including any custom color information, into a cicn.UsageYou can use clip2cicn in one of two ways:• Double-click on the application. Select the "Insert Clipboard into cicn…" from the File menu, choose a file, choose an ID and click insert.• Drag a scheme onto the clip2cicn application. The ID selection dialog will pop up and you can choose where to insert the cicn.Version History1.0b2- now a fat application, so it runs both on 68K machines and PowerMacs- better mask generation- Appearance Manager savvy- cooler about box- improved icon by Lance Robertson1.0b1- Initial releaseFuture Plansclip2cicn does not check if the scheme you're editing is the currently active one, or it its open in any other applications. Future versions will include this checking. Eventually I hope to turn this utility into a full featured Kaleidoscope 2.0 editor.ThanksMike Robinette for showing the original icl8tocicn code snippet.Lance Robertson for redoing the icon so it highlights properly.peterd of #macdev on undernet for helping me get AppleEvents working.The Apple Appearance Manager team for inspiring me to do the about box.
