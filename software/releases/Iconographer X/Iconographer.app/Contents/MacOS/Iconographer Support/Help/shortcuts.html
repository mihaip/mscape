	<P>In addition to this HTML-based help, when running under Mac OS 8.x/9.x, Iconographer also supports balloon help. Simply select Show Balloons from the Help menu, and then point at the thing that interests you (menus, dialogs, and items in the editing window all work), and more details will be given in the balloon that pops up.</P>
	<P>If you still have more questions about Iconographer, you can contact us at <A HREF="mailto:iconographer@mscape.com">iconographer@mscape.com</A> and we'll do our best to help you.</P>

	<P>All of the selection and drawing tools have shortcuts, they are mentioned on the <A HREF="tools.html">tools</A> page.</P>
	<P>Although it is probably obvious that delete fills a selection with the background color (or removes it if it is <A HREF="selections.html">floated</A>), another shortcut is to hold down option while deleting, to fill it with the foreground color.</P>
	<P>To quickly cycle between the current icon and mask, the tab can be used.</P>

	Iconographer has extensive support for drag-and-drop, both within the program and from <A HREF="otherprograms.html">other programs</A> as well. To scale one member to another, all one needs to do is to drag among them. In addition, to make a mask out of the icon contents (a sillouete will be generated), a simple drag from an icon slot into a mask slot is all that is necessary.
