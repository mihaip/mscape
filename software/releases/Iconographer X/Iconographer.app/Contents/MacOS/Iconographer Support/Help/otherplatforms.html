	<P>Iconographer supports both the loading and the saving of icons in the .ico Windows format. The resulting files can then be transferred to a machine running Windows 9x/NT/2000, where they can be used just like any other icon. To load a Windows icon, select the <B>Windows</B> option from the <B>Format</B> pop-up in the file open dialog (<B>Open</B> under the <B>File</B> menu). Once you select a file, it will be placed in an editor window, where you can work with it just like you would with any other icon. One thing to note is that the Windows icon format does not support 8-bit masking, thus any such data will be lost when saving. Thus icons saved in the Windows format possess the same capabilities and limitations as ones stored in the <A HREF="iconbasics.html#formatold">Mac OS Old format</A>. </P>

	<P>Windows XP uses a very similar icon format to its predecessors (.ico files), but with a few improvements. 8-bit masks are now supported, thus enabling the use of semi-transparency, blending and other effects. Additionally, there is an increased emphasis on the 48 x 48 pixel icon size, which is now used in more places throughout the operating system. This makes the Windows XP format very similar to the Mac OS X Server 1.x and <A HREF="iconbasics.html#formatnew">Mac OS New</A> ones. </P>

	<FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">
	<P>Iconographer supports the loading of icons in the .tiff Mac OS X Server 1.x format when QuickTime 4.0 is installed. To load a Mac OS X Server icon, select the <B>Mac OS X Server</B> option from the <B>Format</B> pop-up in the file open dialog (<B>Open</B> under the <B>File</B> menu). Once you select a file, it will be placed in an editor window, where you can work with it just like you would with any other icon. Please note that this format refers to the version of Mac OS X Server that was introduced in 1999, which is based on a different look and feel from the current release of Mac OS X Server. If you wish to create icons for Mac OS X Server version 10.0 or above, you should save your icons in the <A HREF="iconbasics.html#formatosx">Mac OS X format</A>.</P>
