<UL>
	<FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">
	<P><A NAME="info"><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Icon Information: </B></FONT>The info dialog allows you set various options for the icon. Most importantly, you can select the format of the icon. You can also choose which members of this format you would like to use (e.g. if you do not foresee that your icons will be used on a 16 color screen, the 4-bit members are not necessary). Additionally, Mac OS icons are stored as resources, and thus they have an ID, a name and flags.
	<P><A NAME="add"><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Adding Members: </B></FONT>This dialog provides a shortcut for adding a member to an icon. It also allows you to base that member on another one, in order to obtain an approximation of what it should look like. You can hold down option while invoking this command to select the current member as the source.</P>
	<P><A NAME="masks"><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Generating Masks: </B></FONT>Although it is possible to have Iconographer generate the of an icon for you by using <A HREF="shortcuts.html#draganddrop">drag and drop</A> you can also use this command to explicitly create one. It will be based on the current icon, and any white areas on the edge will become transparent. Although this might be enough for simple icons, hand editing of the mask might be necessary for more complicated effects like semi-transparency and having holes.</P>
	<P><A NAME="completion"><FONT COLOR="#330000"><B>Icon Completion: </B></FONT>This command can be used to have Iconographer finish up the icon based on what you already have. It will take the current icon and mask (if any) and fill in the rest of the members that are empty. This can create passable results, but additional tweaking is required if scaling icons up or down.</P>

<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE="4" COLOR="#993300"><B>Transformations</B></FONT>
<UL>
	<FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">
	<P>Iconographer supports a set of simple transformations that can be applied to the current icon or selection. All of them can be access from the <B>Transform</B> sub-menu under the <B>Edit</B> menu. The first set of transformations are rotations. They rotate the current icon or selection 90 degrees in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. The next set of commands deal with horizontal and vertical flips. They mirror the image across the Y and X axes respectively. Finally, the Invert command changes the color to it's complement (e.g. blue becomes yellow, and vice-versa).</P>

<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE="4" COLOR="#993300"><B>Color Adjustments</B></FONT>
<UL>
	<FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">
	<P>Iconographer allows you to perform various color adjustments to the current icon or selection. You can change the hue and saturation, in addition to the brightness and contrast. All of these commands are accessed from the <B>Adjust</B> command, under the <B>Edit</B> menu. You can use the sliders to change any of the parameters. In addition, there is a checkbox, <B>Real-time preview</B>, which allows you to see the results while you're moving the sliders, instead of just at the end.</P>
	<P>Hue is the color of the image. By changing the hue, you are effectively shifting the colors across the spectrum. The saturation of the image is the purity of the color, with gray being the least saturated, and the color at 100% intensity being the most saturated. In addition, there is a colorize checkbox, which allows you to replace all of the colors in the icon or selection with the ones specified in the hue slider.</P>
	<P>The contrast of the image is the ratio between the brightest and darkest areas in an image. So, increasing the contrast increases this ratio, thus making the differences between dark and light areas more apparent. Brightness, as its name suggests, is the overall intensity of an image, so a very bright image would appear to be washed out while one with a low brightness would be dark.</P>

<FONT FACE="Helvetica,Arial" SIZE="4" COLOR="#993300"><B>Copy and Paste</B></FONT>
<UL>
	<FONT FACE="Geneva,Arial" SIZE="2">
	<P>Using the clipboard to copy and paste is a standard Mac behavior which Iconographer supports. If a select is made, it can be copied, and if the clipboard contains any graphical data, it can be pasted into a new selection.</P>
	<P>However, Iconographer also supports additional copy and paste commands. To better integrate with <A HREF="otherprograms.html">other programs</A>, there are commands for copying and pasting both the current icon and the mask. Additionally, it is possible to copy and paste the entire icon family (all of the members). This feature is useful for transferring one icon to another, for putting an icon onto a Finder item (simply select it, use the Get Info command, click on the icon and use the Paste command) and for transferring the icon into a resource editor such as ResEdit or Resorcerer.</P>
