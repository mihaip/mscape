Thank you very much for registering clip2icns. To disable the reminder that appears every 10 icons you create, open the application and select the Register... command from the Apple menu. This brings up a dialog box where you enter your name, organization, and registration code. You must enter the following items exactly as they are shown below:

Name: <username>
Registration Code: <regnumber>

Be sure to enter in the registration code exactly as it appears here. The registration code is made up only of numbers, it does not contain any letters. Be sure to save this registration code; you will need to enter it again when you move to a new machine or reinstall your system.

Now that you have registered, you will remain registered for all future version of clip2icns, even if new features are added and the price is raised.

Please feel free to send me your questions, comments, or suggestions. I can be reached by email at:
        mihai@mscape.com
There isn't any snail-mail or telephone support for clip2icns.

Please note that we do not send out updates of clip2icns or notices of new versions. However, we do regularly make new versions available at the official clip2icns page:
        http://www.mscape.com/products.html
Announcements to Mac news sites will also be made for major releases.

Thanks again for supporting the shareware concept and this program in particular.
