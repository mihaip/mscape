Hello,

For my first product at Kagi (clip2icns) I want to use a serial number based on the name that the user provides. Here is the algoritm:

this function is case sensitive
take the first 24 characters of the name (if less than that fill it up with spaces)
the result is a 6 character string
take the first 6 characters of the name, get the last digit of each of their ascii codes (so mod them by 10) and put those into the the first 6 characters of the return string
repeat that for the next 3 sets of 6 characters (add them on to what's already in the result string)
take the first character of the result string, add 2 to it, mod it by 10 and add '0' (that's the ASCII code of 0), so the result will be a number (in the ASCII character set)
ditto for the 2nd character, but now add 4
ditto for the 3rd character, but now add 0
ditto for the 4rd character, but now add 9
ditto for the 5rd character, but now add 9
ditto for the 6rd character, but now add 8

In the end you should get a 6 character string that's all digits

Here are some sample values:

Mihai Parparita: 647258
Mike Robinette: 806460
Arlo Rose: 273676
Maury McCown: 048834
Murray Chapman: 002422
Alex Moritz: 200971
Curtis Townson: 363887
Tracy Ann Connolly: 300074
Ed Deans: 538361

Doug Zartman: 137522
